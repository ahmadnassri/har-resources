# HAR Resources

A hand curated, [community driven](#contributing) list of resources, tools, projects and applications that support [HTTP Archive format (HAR)](https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!forum/http-archive-specification).

## About

### [HTTP Archive Spec](http://www.softwareishard.com/blog/har-12-spec/)

The widely used HTTP Archive Format (HAR) format specification was initially designed by the [HttpWatch](http://www.httpwatch.com/company/) and [Firebug](http://getfirebug.com/) teams *([Jan Odvarko](http://www.softwareishard.com/blog/about/) together with [Steve Souders](http://stevesouders.com/) and [Simon Perkins](http://www.httpwatch.com/company/))* as an open, portable JSON file format based on the HttpWatch XML file export. It is now supported by many browsers and HTTP sniffing / monitoring tools making it easier to exchange HTTP log files and to export collected data. it has since been adopted by all main HTTP tracking tools.

## Videos

- [Make The Web Fast - The HAR Show: Capturing and Analyzing performance data with HTTP Archive format](https://www.youtube.com/watch/?v=FmsLJHikRf8)  
  > Need a flexible format to record, export, and analyze network performance data? Well, that's exactly what the HTTP Archive format (HAR) is designed to do! Even better, did you know that Chrome DevTools supports it? In this episode we'll take a deep dive into the format (as you'll see, its very simple), and explore the many different ways it can help you capture and analyze your sites performance.

  > Join +Ilya Grigorik and +Peter Lubbers to find out how to capture HAR network traces in Chrome, visualize the data via an online tool, share the reports with your clients and coworkers, automate the logging and capture of HAR data for your build scripts, and even adapt it to server-side analysis use cases! Yes, a rapid fire session of awesome demos - see you there.
