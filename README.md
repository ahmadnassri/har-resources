## About [HTTP Archive Spec](http://www.softwareishard.com/blog/har-12-spec/)

The widely used HTTP Archive Format (HAR) format specification was initially designed by the [HttpWatch](http://www.httpwatch.com/company/) and [Firebug](http://getfirebug.com/) teams *([Jan Odvarko](http://www.softwareishard.com/blog/about/) together with [Steve Souders](http://stevesouders.com/) and [Simon Perkins](http://www.httpwatch.com/company/))* as an open, portable JSON file format based on the HttpWatch XML file export. It is now supported by many browsers and HTTP sniffing / monitoring tools making it easier to exchange HTTP log files and to export collected data. it has since been adopted by all main HTTP tracking tools.
