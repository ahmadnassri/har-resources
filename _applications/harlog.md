Utility to take the HAR output and create a log format that can be imported into Excel or some other charting tool. HarLog can also generate a "pivot table" style report summarizing data from a collection of HAR files. This is useful if you wish to get average page performance over time and or you would like to baseline the performance of a site under development across versions.
