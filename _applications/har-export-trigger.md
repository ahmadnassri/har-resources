Firefox add-on for automated HAR (HTTP Archive) export. This add-on is built on top of native developer tools in Firefox and allows automated export of all collected and computed data from the **Network** panel. Automation can be implemented on top of HAR API that are exposed directly to the page. It can be also used together with e.g. Selenium to implement automated HAR export robots. Firebug is not needed for this add-on.
