<h2 id="about">About the <a href="http://www.softwareishard.com/blog/har-12-spec/" target="_blank">HTTP Archive Spec</a></h2>

<p>The widely used HTTP Archive Format (HAR) format specification was initially designed by the <a href="http://www.httpwatch.com/company/" target="_blank">HttpWatch</a> and <a href="http://getfirebug.com/" target="_blank">Firebug</a> teams <em>(<a href="http://www.softwareishard.com/blog/about/" target="_blank">Jan Odvarko</a> together with <a href="http://stevesouders.com/" target="_blank">Steve Souders</a> and <a href="http://www.httpwatch.com/company/" target="_blank">Simon Perkins</a>)</em> as an open, portable JSON file format based on the HttpWatch XML file export. It is now supported by many browsers and HTTP sniffing / monitoring tools making it easier to exchange HTTP log files and to export collected data. it has since been adopted by all main HTTP tracking tools.</p>
