> A few years ago, I set a goal to foster the creation of an Internet Performance Archive. The idea is similar to the Internet Archive. But whereas the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine provides a history of the Web’s state of HTML, IPA would provide a history of the Web’s state of performance: total bytes downloaded, number of images, scripts, stylesheets, use of compression, etc. as well as results from performance analysis tools like YSlow and Page Speed. Early versions of this idea can be seen in Show Slow and Cesium.
