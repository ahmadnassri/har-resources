> I was going to talk about pizza and saving network logs. The other day, in my quest for an appetite I ordered a pizza home from a lovely site called JustEats. They have some pretty good devs on board, and I quite like what they do. However this particular day I was getting a 500 every time I tried to place an order- in Chrome only. I decided to save the log and email them it in an archive format called HAR (an archive format for HTTP transactions).
